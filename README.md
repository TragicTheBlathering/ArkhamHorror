# Arkham Horror (Tragic Edition) - a Tabletop Simulator Mod

This is my github for my AH mod for TTS. 

Your welcome to use it as you like. I have the code for the mod as well as the save game file uploaded here. So you can just download the save file and load it in TTS to try the out the latest, bleeding edge version of this mod.

This mod uses my growing Library of tools and code snippets extensively. As I am modifying and making my mods it is getting constantly updated. It contains scripts and snips code I use all the time as well as some large form tools like my Trashcans. These files are required for modifying my code.

This is very much work in progress and will be going through a lot of changes... I'm not a programmer but self-taught as I learned modding.. so I get that it is a total mess and could be a real pain for others to read and cause actual pain to people that know what they are doing. Still, it is what it is!

Have Fun and ROLL SIGNS<br>
